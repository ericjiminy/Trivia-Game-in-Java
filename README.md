# Trivia-Game-in-Java
Trivia game made in Java. Uses OpenTrivia API.

The GUI takes in desired number of questions, category, and difficulty. These are put into the OpenTrivia URL and the question data from the API is stored into arrays that are accessed as the user answers the questions.

A toolbar lets users return to the intro screen to start a new game. It also shows the current question's category and difficulty.

At the end of the game, the details of the quiz and the final score are displayed.

The OpenTrivia API doesn't have that many questions for certain categories, but a lot of them are fine.
